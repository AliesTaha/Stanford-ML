## Project Summaries

### Supervised Learning Models with NumPy and scikit-learn

- **Technologies Used:** Python, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Focus:** I concentrated on building supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks. This involved employing linear regression models for predicting continuous outcomes and logistic regression for binary classification problems. Through this process, I gained hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques.

### Neural Network and TensorFlow Projects

#### Hand-Written Digit Recognition

- **Technologies Used:** TensorFlow, NumPy
- **Dataset:** MNIST
- **Overview:** I built a neural network model to recognize hand-written digits. Initially, I used TensorFlow to create and train the model efficiently. Subsequently, I explored the underlying mechanisms by implementing the forward propagation of the neural network in NumPy. This project provided me with a deep understanding of neural network architectures and the operational dynamics of machine learning frameworks.

#### Multiclass Classification Neural Network

- **Focus:** Extending upon the previous project, I developed a neural network capable of multiclass classification to recognize digits from 0 to 9. This involved integrating the ReLu activation function in hidden layers and employing the Softmax activation function for the output layer to handle multiple classes.
- **Technologies Used:** TensorFlow
- **Learning Outcome:** This project deepened my grasp of adapting neural network structures for different types of classification tasks and fine-tuning model parameters to enhance performance.

### Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods

- **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn
- **Focus:** I explored the construction and application of decision trees, random forests, and boosted trees (XGBoost) for classification and regression tasks. This exploration included understanding the theory behind these models, their application in solving real-world problems, and the techniques for tuning these models to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.

## Skills and Experience Gained

- Proficiency in Python for machine learning, including data manipulation and model building.
- Deep understanding of machine learning algorithms, encompassing both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.
